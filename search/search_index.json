Utilizing a light sensor we will turn the system on or off based on what rooms are currently lit up. Once the sensor detects light two thermistors will activate and begin measuring the rooms temnperature and comparing it to the temperature against the window. Based on these readings signals will be sent to two different motors for actuation. They will then raise or lower the blind, and open or close the slats to maintain a steady room temperature passively without physical interaction between a human and blinds.</li> <li>The full team report. can be found here detailing each members constructed systems and contributions.</li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<ul> <li>This needs to be updated to reflect a team introduction</li> <li>Content should also help an unfamiliar reader navigate to areas of interest.

It will require the most work to code a filter to process data which is required, and if broken it is the easiest part to replace quickly. This Thermistor also has the worst tolerances which allows for extra experience fine tuning until we reach our desired results.</p> <p>Other Notes: While I am using the MCP6004 Op-amp, the LM7805 Voltage regulator, and the 3 pin barrel jack I did not include a component selection for these 3 parts as they were supplied to us in class, and I am unfamiliar with any alternatives. I decided to stick with these three parts as I have gained experince using them in labs, and already have the parts available to me without needing to order any additional parts or components. The Thermistor recieved its own component selection as we did not have a lab based around its use, and I had to research multiple thermistors that would meet project requirements.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>The Bill of Materials included below displays all major components required in the construction of the PCB.
