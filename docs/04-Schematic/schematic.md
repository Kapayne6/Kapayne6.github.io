## Overview

This schematic is designed to recieve a high or low signal to begin collecting data from 2 thermistors, collect the values output by the thermistors, and then send that data to another teamates PIC board as a high or low signal. Those signals will then begin to trigger motor actuation allowing for temperature control and maintinence using the blinds.
