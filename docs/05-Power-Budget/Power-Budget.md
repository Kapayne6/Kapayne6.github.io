title: Power Budget
---

## Overview

I constructed a power budget to properly manage and visualize the power demands of my schematic and PCB. This allowed me to track the voltage required as well as the draw of amps for each different component dependent on what rail they are connected to.

## Conclusions

Based on my power budget my system should have more than enough amps left over without much draw or demand coming from my system.

## Resouces

The power budget as a PDF download is available [*here*](Power_Budget_KP.pdf), and a Microsoft Excel Sheet [*here*](Power_Budget_KP.xlsx).
